Name: Haein Lee

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 4

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

| Module                    | Selected Module |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Cloud Databases           |                 |
| Data Analysis             |                 |
| Game Framework            |                 |
| GIS Mapping               |                 |
| Mobile App                | X               |
| Networking                |                 |
| SQL Relational Databases  |                 |
| Web Apps                  |                 |
| C++                       |                 |
| Java                      |                 |
| Kotlin                    |                 |
| Erlang                    |                 |
| TypeScript                |                 |

| Choose Your Own Adventure |                 |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas. In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected. For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements. List the unique module requirements below:
   Create a Mobile App using one of the following platforms:
   Android - Java or Kotlin
   iOS - Swift - Note that you need a Mac using XCode for this option
   React Native - Javascript - Creates Android/iOS compatible apps
   Flutter/Dart - Creates Web/Android/iOS compatible apps

The app must have the following characteristics:
Have at least one screen
Be interactive with the user (e.g. responds to inputs by displaying appropriate outputs)

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? I have selected YouTube videos and Google as my primary sources for learning the technical material. YouTube offers a wide range of tutorials and courses on mobile app development, while Google allows me to search for specific topics and find relevant articles, documentation, and forums for additional help.

2. What is your plan to practice the new material? In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? Watch introductory YouTube videos to understand the basics and differences between iOS and Android development. Follow tutorials to set up Android Studio for Android and Xcode for iOS. Learn Java/Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS through beginner tutorials.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
   For the demonstration software at the end of the Sprint, I plan on submitting a mobile painting application developed in Kotlin, featuring canvas drawing, brush customization, undo functionality, an eraser tool, and canvas clearing capabilities.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   M: 3-5PM Home W: 3-6PM Home T: 3-5PM Home F: 3-5PM Home S:1-2PM Home

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan? I will allocate extra time for research and debugging to ensure that I can overcome any technical challenges. I will set specific, achievable goals for each study session and track my progress regularly.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

| Date    | Start Time | IM or TP | Description               | Hours:Minutes |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| June 10 | 2:15       | IM       | study for code            | 2H 30Mins     |
| June 11 | 4:00       | IM       | start to make my own code | 1H 30Mins     |
| June 13 | 10:30      | IM       | make script for Kotlin    | 2H            |

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

| Question                                                     | Response |

| Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                    | Yes      |
| Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                   | Yes      |
| Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder?  | Yes      |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
   I did not complete a Stretch Challenge for this module.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
   I did not change my selected module during the middle of the Sprint.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 12H 20Minutes       |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   Setting specific, achievable goals for each day helped maintain focus and productivity. Some tasks took longer than expected, causing minor delays in the overall timeline.
